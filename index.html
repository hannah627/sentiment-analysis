                <h2>What This Is</h2>
                <div class="explanationSubSections">
                    <p>This is a tool to perform sentiment analysis on text(s), explore why and how certain scores were
                        given, and edit
                        those scores as necessary.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="explanationSubSections">
                    <p>First, choose which lexicons you'd like to apply (words and scores you'd like to look for), along
                        with words you
                        don't want scored (stop words), in the Options section.</p>
                    <p>Next, upload the file or files you'd like scored, or copy and paste the text into the given text
                        box.</p>
                    <p>Then, explore your results by looking at the graphs of document or token scores, and the full
                        text of whatever you
                        uploaded, which will have scored words highlighted. Hover over those scored words to see their
                        score and the lexicon
                        the score came from.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="explanationSubSections">
                    <p>If you want to adjust the score of one or more words, download the template lexicon from the
                        Options section and
                        input the word and your preferred score, then save it, upload it as a custom lexicon, and re-run
                        the tool to see
                        your changes reflected. If you want one or more words to not be scored, just download the
                        template stop words list
                        from the Options section, add the word(s), save it, and upload it as a custom stop words list.
